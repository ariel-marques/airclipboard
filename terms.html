    <h1 class="mb-4 fw-bold">ɅirClipboard – Terms of Service</h1>

    <p>These Terms govern your use of the ɅirClipboard app, available exclusively for macOS, developed and operated by Ariel Marques.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-5">1. App Usage</h2>
    <p>
      ɅirClipboard is a clipboard manager designed for macOS users. By downloading, installing, or using the app, you agree to comply with these Terms of Service.<br>
      ɅirClipboard is compatible with macOS 13 (Ventura) and later. Older versions of macOS are not officially supported.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">2. Product Versions</h2>
    <p>
      ɅirClipboard offers a free version with limited functionality (e.g., history limited to 3 items) and Pro versions available via one-time purchase or monthly subscription.<br>
      The current price for the Pro version is $14.99 USD (one-time license), covering up to 3 personal macOS devices.<br>
      Prices are subject to change at any time without prior notice.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">3. Licensing and Activation</h2>
    <p>
      Licenses are personal, tied to a unique email address, and are non-transferable. Activation occurs locally on your device without sending clipboard data externally.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">4. Sales and Payment Processing</h2>
    <p>
      All payments are securely processed through Paddle, our authorized reseller and Merchant of Record. Paddle handles billing, receipts, taxes (where applicable), and order fulfillment.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">5. Refund Policy</h2>
    <p>
      Customers are eligible for a refund within 14 days of purchase, as outlined in Paddle's <a href="https://www.paddle.com/legal/checkout-buyer-terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buyer Terms of Use</a>. After 14 days, refunds are generally not available. For more details, please review our <a href="/airclipboard/refund">Refund Policy</a>.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">6. Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      ɅirClipboard respects your privacy. No clipboard content or personal data is collected or transmitted to external servers. Please refer to our <a href="/airclipboard/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> for further information.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">7. Modifications</h2>
    <p>
      We may update these Terms periodically. Continued use of the app after changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms.
